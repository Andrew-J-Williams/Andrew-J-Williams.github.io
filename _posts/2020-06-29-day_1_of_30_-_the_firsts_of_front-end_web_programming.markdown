I got off to a late start today, the flooring business has not slowed down and work was still to be done even as office hours ended. Having just wrapped up my 3rd project using Ruby on Rails, I went ahead and scheduled my assessment for the earliest day that had the latest possible time: next Tuesday. Amidst reviewing and refining my Rails knowledge, I decided to continue forward with my learning, embarking on 4 lessons dealing with the basics surronding front-end web programming. 

When I talk about web programming, I am referring to 2 specific practices (the lesson makes it 3 but I shortened it for the sake of simplicity):

1. Creating documents with HTML and CSS components 
2. Utilizing Javascript for interactivity and server communication

A lot of the website we use on a daily basis were constructed by programmers using these practices, and the I more I learn about the process the more I begin to deconstruct and discover an application's basic building blocks. The example of the "like" or "favorite" we see on Facebook, Twitter, or many other websites is broken down in one of the introduction lessons. In that short period of time where you go to like one of your friend's posts, a lot of actions are taking place within the web application. The program interacts with the user, gathers data, analyzes the data, and then stores the information so it can be used for the developer's purposes.

The lesson used the example of 3 Pillars to explain what is happening in these applications. Under the 1st pillar, Recognizing Events, the Javascript incorporated into a program is written in such a way that a user's actions will prompt the JS to perform a specific task. In the case of a Facebook like, the JS is being told by the user to modify the appearance of the "like" icon. The 2nd pillar, Manipulating the DOM, refers to the Javascript completing the work that it was assigned by the user, in the example previously mentioned it would update the like icon from white to blue. Finally, the third pillar, Communicating with the Server, involves the JS storing the user's information in such a way that it can be used for other uses, some specific to the developers. Below is a helpful image provided with the lesson that visually puts these concepts into perspective:

I am now in the process of learning how the DOM (Document-Object Model) and Javascript are related. Getting a taste of Javascript after having dealt with Ruby for so long feels both familiar yet foreign. Writing in JS, you use many of the same functions found in Ruby, such as assigning values to variables, using arrays, and even the use of conditionals. Where they differ significantly is in the syntax, and the best way I can think to describe it is like putting an English statement next to a Spanish statement. While some things look close to the same, the structure and spelling is noticeably different. I think the most challenging thing for me was reading through a JS for loop, just trying to understand the logic of what was written. 

On a more disappointing note, while I did have a chance to complete a lab, the submission process was not working on the Learn website, so I will sadly have to receive credit another day for it. It's strange how sometimes the tiniest of issues can seemingly make the situation so much more of a downer. At first you think you're doing something wrong, but then you check the "Ask a Question" section and are quickly relieved to find you aren't the only one. Flipping it into a positive, at least one other day this week I can add an extra lab completion to my total for the day!
