My name is Andy. I'm a dad working full-time in Houston, Texas balancing the craziness of life all while learning to code. I think I can speak for everyone when I say 2020 has been a fairly turbulent year. It certainly has affected me in more ways than one. I work 45 hour work weeks and have experienced little slow down in light of the virus, meaning I have faced an increasing tendency outside of work to waste my time on trivial things instead of focusing on school work. Learning to code is not an easy task, and as such it demands consistent attention and practice.

While circumstances outside of my control have limited my ability to focus, there are certainly many aspects of my personal life that are still within the realm of my control. As the month of June begins tomorrow, I have decided I will use the new period as an opporunity to chronicle my journey through coding. Looking back I wish I had been proactive in maintaining a daily (or even weekly) blog when I first started at Flatiron School, but as I see things it's never too late to start now.

Over the next 30 days I will be using this blog as a means of accountability in my journey to becoming a software engineer. Ultimately, the goal would be to go beyond just 30 days, potentially being a resource of encouragement to those in similar situations. When I first started out in college, my goal was to become a computer engineer. But after a disaterous first semester, I lost a significant amount of confidence and decided to pursue a different major. While I found great interest in what I chose to study, it always ate at me for years that I never completed what I originally set out to do. For the longest time I had just accepted it was a lost cause, and life went on.

But then I discovered Flatiron School, which immediately renewed the passion I had for programming. The pre-work was fun and addicting, I kept wanting to find out what the next lesson had in store. The concepts were clicking in my mind, and before I knew it I was submitting my application to join the self-paced program. After being accepted, I felt like I was on a roll and couldn't wait to see what was next. But then the pandemic hit, and the uncertainty of the situation (as mentioned before) took its toll on me. 

While it has taken some time, I've believe a daily blog will be the best method moving forward in maintaining motivation to complete these courses. If you find your self in a similar situation, I encourage you to share your thoughts as well as your strategies as I embark on a challenge I've never attempted before. Ready or not, this post will serve as an introduction to the next 30 days of coding! I'm challenging myself as well as any aspiring engineers reading this to never give up despite the circumstances that seemingly keep you down.
