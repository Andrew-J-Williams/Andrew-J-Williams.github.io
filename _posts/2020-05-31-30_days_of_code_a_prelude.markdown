I may have bit off a little more than I could chew with my 4th project if I'm being completely honest. That being said, I can say with certainty that this project was by far the most satisfying to complete to date. Given the requirements for the project, I was strongly encouraged to make an application around something I would be excited to talk about. I didn't have to think very hard on that one, and in an effort to challenge myself, I decided to create an SPA that focused on telling one of the most important stories of the Civil War: the Battle of Gettysburg. Sure, it may have been an obvious choice when looking at critical events from the war, but being a history buff (as well as having a wife who majored in history) I just couldn't help myself.

I knew from the very early stages of planning my project that I wanted my application to have 3 central features:
1. A map with various markers that users could click to unveil information concerning that location.
2. A discussion section where users could post information/debate among each other concerning various events.
3. An interactive, critical thinking section that would give users the choice to make important battle decisions.

This was definitely a first for me: while my previous projects took inspiration from my daily work experience, I would be in uncharted water making an application with a relatively custom layout and features. As a result, my application class structure initially looked like this:
